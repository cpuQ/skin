# hello
this is my osu skin [(download here)](https://github.com/cpuQ/skin/releases/latest)  
inspired by the rafis hddt 2018 skin so you may recognize some of the assets
- (mostly) everythng is hand drawn and written
- ui sounds are made by me
- hitsounds are from the rafis skin
- 1mb skin so its VERY fast and performance is 
- theres dt and no mod skins :D
- may look goofy but is actually well thought out pls notic

0s are golden because you can know if youre always 100% accuracy or not, which you will never be.
