# hello
this is my osu skin [(download here)](https://github.com/cpuQ/skin/releases/latest)  
inspired by the rafis hddt 2018 skin so you may recognize some of the assets
- (mostly) everything is hand drawn / written
- ui sounds are made by me yes
- hitsounds are mostly from the rafis skin
- 1mb skin so its very light weight
- may look silly but is actually well thought out pls notice
- has high res elements only for playfield elements

# RED
- experimental super duper ultra mega hd dt / tech / no mod skin! [(download cpuQ-RED)](https://github.com/cpuQ/skin/releases/tag/red-1.4)
- 'triplestack' and 'instafade' versions available
- under 1mb! if you remove 2x res it will be like 500kb lol

### the cursor (recommended size is 0.8-0.7)
a non disruptive trail so you can focus on where youre actually aiming...

### score numbers
0s are golden because you can know if youre always 100% accuracy or not, which you will never be.

its easy to see, trust me. also i added an arrow so you dont get confused where the slider is headed in those super slow sliders at the end of the map because a lot of people break yknow...
