# hello
this is my osu skin [(download)](https://github.com/cpuQ/skin/releases/latest)  
it is made for ME so i dont expect you to like it or not but it is fine tuned to my preference.  
it based off of the rafis hddt 2018 skin but heavily modified so you might recognize some of the assets (i also stole muse dash sounds)  
and it also inspired from other things from other skins but idek anymore just use it  
some hitsounds i just make but i might change it later  
(yes everythng is hand drawn / written) besides the main components ofc

## here is the circle numbers
the little dots are useful for seeing stacked objects, especially with hidden mod! you will know once you play with it

## the cursor (recommended size is 0.85)
a non disruptive trail so you can focus on where youre actually aiming...

## recommended setting is to have equal volume for hitsound and music

## score numbers
0s are golden because you can know if youre always 100% accuracy or not, which, you will never be.

## sliders
its easy to see, trust me. also i added an arrow so you dont get confused where the slider is headed in those super slow sliders at the end of the map because a lot of people break yknow...
