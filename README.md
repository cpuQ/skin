# hello
this is my osu skin

it is based off of the rafis hddt 2018 skin but heavily modified so you might recognize some of the hitsounds (i also stole muse dash sounds uwu owo)

and it has other things from other skins idek anymore just use it

oh and make sure you play 100% background dim but like everyone does that so

some hitsounds i just make but i might change it later
